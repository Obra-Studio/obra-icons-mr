Today I recorded another tutorial video, where we try to make a more advanced icon based on a reference.

Yesterday I recorded a <a href="/blog/tutorial-1">video</a>. which focuses on some basics. At the end of the video we ended up with a document icon. This video focusses on the techniques needed to create a butterfly icon. 

This new video goes through some more advanced technique techniques including

1. Joining vectors in vector mode
2. Changing the properties of vector points (mirrored curve)
3. How to enter outline mode
4. Pixel preview and snap to pixel

If you like this, leave a comment or give like to the video, so I know to make more videos like this.
