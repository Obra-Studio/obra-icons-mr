Today I recorded another tutorial video, where we try to make a more advanced icon based on a reference.

The <a href="/blog/tutorial-1">video  from yesterday</a> focuses on on some basics. At the end of the video we ended up with a document icon. This video focusses on the techniques needed to create a butterfly icon. 

I want to apologize for the roughness of above videos, I am making them more for myself and as a reference to some people I am working with than an actual professionally produced tutorial. They are helping me to figure out what should be shown in a tutorial. As you can see in above video, sometimes when creating an icon, the struggle is real.

This new video goes through some more advanced technique techniques including

1. Joining vectors in vector mode
2. Changing the properties of vector points (mirrored curve)
3. How to enter outline mode
4. Pixel preview and snap to pixel

If you like this, leave a comment or give like to the video, so I know to make more videos like this.
