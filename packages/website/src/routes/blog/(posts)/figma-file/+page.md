We posted a version of the icons that you could use to design your projects here
on [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1511878363179181235). This file tracks the latest development
version and contains all 1048 icons.

There is more to do for us: add keywords, create Figma components out of the icons... but for now, this could already
help you forward if you design with Obra Icons.
