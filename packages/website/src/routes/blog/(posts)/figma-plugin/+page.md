We released a Figma plugin for Obra Icons. You can find it on the Figma
community <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1417969026159731234/obra-icons">here</a>.

The plugins contains 1000+ icons in 3 weights: 2px, 1.5px and 1px. You can use a slider to set the size, change the
colour, and the plugin will remember your settings.

It includes the Obra Icons keyword search, where you can search icons not just by their name, but also by extensive
extra keywords.
